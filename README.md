# Bibliocentric Application

From Monday 16th June to Monday 23rd June 2020 I plan to create an application that uses a backend database to store collections of books, a frontend GUI to view and edit the entries and a middle-manager to allow GUI to database interaction. 	

The app is form cataloging a personal book collection. I hope that the functionaity allows for an intuitive and smooth operation.

The Application is called Bibliocentric, from the Greek &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#957; (Biblio: meaning book) and &#954;&#949;&#957;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; (kentrikos: meaning at the centre)

#### Project Goal:

> Create an application to store, view and manage book collections.

#### Definition of Done:

>- Business layer passes all unit tests
>- GUI is funtional and logical
>- Clarity between the GUI and database
>- GUI functions as expected

Overall Project Retrospective
-

From this project I have learnt the power of Agile development and SCRUM practices. It has been good to split the overwhelming project in to manageable chuncks.

Each Sprint has presented their own challenges, but knowing that the backlog is smaller eases the potential pressure that could have built up.

Obviously I have learnt a lot about WPF, NUnit, C# and SQL over this process, however I have learnt more about my own drive and determination. I have found that I am more able to overcome issues better than I was aware.

All I have shown in this project is new to me, I have learnt it over the last 7 weeks. I have surprised myself with what I have created.

### At the Start of the project
- I was overwhelmed with the task
- I had no idea what to do for my projects
- I did not know where to start
- I was concerned about my own ability

### Throughout the project
- I grew in confidence
- I trusted my ability
- I allowed the agile process to help me structure the chaos 
- I did not let issues in the code throw me off-course

### At the End of the project
- I am happy with how I have learnt to handle issues
- I am very pleased with the result of my work
- I want to see how far I can take this applicaton in my own time

I am happy with how I taken to agile. It has shaped the project to be something I am proud of. The goal of moving towards a minimum viable product at the end of each sprint made it easy to see real progress and consistently test the UI functionality.

If I were to do this project again, I think the biggest thing I would do differently is to seek simple solutions to issues before trying overly complicated '*hacks*'.

To take this further, I would add "Lent out" functionality, book cover images and labelling for catergorisation (i.e. Ordered by title/author surname would be split by letter under the heading "A", "B", "C", etc.).
