# Bibliocentric Application

From Monday 16th June to Monday 23rd June 2020 I plan to create an application that uses a backend database to store collections of books, a frontend GUI to view and edit the entries and a middle-manager to allow GUI to database interaction.

The Application is called Bibliocentric, from the Greek Biblio (meaning book) and kentrikos (meaning at the centre)

#### Project Goal:

> Create an application to store, view and manage book collections.

#### Definition of Done:

>- Business layer passes all unit tests
>- GUI is funtional and logical
>- Clarity between the GUI and database
>- GUI functions as expected
